# Trivia for Technicians
The study app you didn't realize you needed!

Using this app pharmacy technician students will be able to register an account, login, and be able to 
view our selection of various quizes (currently one!). Each quiz has  it's own set of case studies that
the students can read and learn from before and after taking the quiz. All of their quiz attempts are
saved in their history, and so they can easily view how they've been doing in past attempts, and what
they should improve on.

During the quiz itself for each question they answer correctly or incorrectly they will recieve an
explanation of why their answer was right or wrong, further allowing students to easily use this as
a method of study without requiring a textbook or a computer present, as everything they needed is present
right in th app itself.

On the technical side of things we are developing for Android 5.1 Lollipop in order to maximize compatibility 
as the app is fairly simple, and doesn't require advanced features, and we doubt that the vast majority of our
target demographic (College or University students) would have a device running anything older than that.
