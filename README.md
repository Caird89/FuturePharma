# FuturePharma
ParmaTech Android Application

The purpose of our FuturePharma app will be to help Pharmtech students study. The focus will be on  a multiple 
choice with five questions and 3-4 answers that will all be a part of the same broader topic.

Answering correctly may further explain why the answer was correct, this is to be decided. Similarly answering
incorrectly will provide an explanation as to why the answer was incorrect. 

We will be using Android Studio and developing for Android 5.1 Lollipop in order to maximize compatibility as 
the app is fairly simple, and doesn't require advanced features, and we doubt that the vast majority of our target
demographic (College or University students) would have a device running anything older than that.
