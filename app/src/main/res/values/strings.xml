      Bob is a regular patient of a community pharmacy who is not covered by any insurance comes with a prescription for clarithromycin 500mg BID for 7 days.
\n\n
Jane, the pharmacy technician, in the pharmacy is aware that Bob does not have any insurance coverage and also his work hours are recently cut down by several hours.
\n\n
Jane can either fill this prescriptions 14 of the 500mg tablets or 28 of the 250mg tablets. Bob has to pay $45 for 14 of 500mg tablets, whereas only $25 for 28 of the 250mg tablets.
\n\n
Jane looks in the inventory for 250mg tablets and finds that there are none. So, she decides to dispense 500 mg tablets without informing the patient of the situation and charges him with $45 leading to the patient paying $20 more for this prescription without complete knowledge.
